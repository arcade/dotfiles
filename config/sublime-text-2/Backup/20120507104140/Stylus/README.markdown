# Stylus Package for Sublime Editor 2

An extension for Sublime Text 2.

Build system and syntax hi-lighting for Stylus language

## Limitations

**Not tested on windows, I don't expect the build to work without modification**
*Please will a windows user fork this project, and get it working on windows*

*It has been confirmed as working on ubuntu 11.10, so I assume it should work on other flavors, but I have not tested any others*

**It works for me because I have installed Stylus (via npm) and have it in my path**

## Install

### Package Control

The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control).

 * If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text 2 before doing this next bit.
 * Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows).
 * Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
 * Select Stylus when the list appears.

Package Control will automatically keep Git up to date with the latest version.
